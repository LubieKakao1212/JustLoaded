## JustLoaded (ModLoader)

### Description
JustLoaded is a modular ModLoader supporting .Net 6 and newer 

The primary target for this project are game developers which want to make games with good modding support out of the box, modders willing to add mod support for existing games are also welcome to use this

### Supported GameEngines and Platforms
#### Regarding Engines
Every engine which supports at least .Net 6 should work with JustLoaded. This includes:
- Godot
- Stride
- MonoGame

Unity does not support .Net 6 however it will in near future, when that happens it will also be supported

#### Regarding platforms
Any platforms requiring Native AOT may only have limited functionality available since it doesn't support runtime assembly loading
