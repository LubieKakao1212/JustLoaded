## JustLoaded (ModLoader)

### Description
JustLoaded is a modular ModLoader for .NET 

The primary target for this project are game developers which want to make games with good modding support out of the box, modders willing to add mod support for existing games are also welcome to use this

### Supported GameEngines and Platforms
#### Regarding Engines
Every engine which supports .net scripting should work with JustLoaded. This includes:
- Unity
- Godot
- Less popular engines such as Stride should also work
 
Frameworks such as MonoGame are also supported

#### Regarding platforms
Any platforms requiring Native AOT may only have limited functionality available since it doesn't support runtime assembly loading

### Documentation and examples
NYI

### Notes
I am currently testing JustLoaded using MonoGame as well as Unity. So far I had no major issues with the library apart from missing features which will be added in the future.
